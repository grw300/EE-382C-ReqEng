\section{Product Overview}

We envision the creating of a Electronic Health Records Management System that empowers independent health care providers to effectively create, maintain and provide access to patient records. The System will push the ownership of medical records towards the patient. We see the ability to provide enhanced security that meets and excess Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements without burdening the providers with excess legalese. We see the system as a way for providers to give patients ownership over their health records and inspire patient loyalty with easy-to-use public facing interfaces for patient applications (mobile applications/website access);
